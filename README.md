## qemo-IO-test

based off https://github.com/jserv/armv8-hello and https://wiki.osdev.org/ARM_RaspberryPi_Tutorial_C

Run a custom kernel on a hardware-emulated raspberry pi 3.

notes:
- since raspberry pi 4 is not yet supported by qemu raspi3 is running
- output "Hello World" sometimes looses characters or prints different chars
